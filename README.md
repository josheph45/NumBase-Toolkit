# NumBase-Toolkit

[Demo](https://youtu.be/P8Wmq1zhK10)

A production-grade CLI tool for pedagogical number system operations. It implements successive division, substitution, and rapid bit-grouping conversions, alongside column-wise arithmetic performed directly in the target base p∈{2,3,…,16}.

## Features

- **Conversion Methods**: Successive division, Substitution, and Intermediate Base (Base 10).
- **Rapid Conversion**: Optimized bit-grouping for bases 2, 4, 8, 16.
- **Direct Arithmetic**: Add, Subtract, Multiply (by digit), and Divide (by digit) without leaving the source base.
